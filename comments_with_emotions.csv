"If this fight were real and not just an exhibition like Tyson's match against Roy Jones Jr., I think it would be pretty one-sided. Tyson is far too old to go up against a young fighter like Jake. Even if Tyson wins, it might be because Jake let it happen, or they agreed on it beforehand. Realistically, I believe Jake would take the victory unless Tyson somehow lands the perfect punch at the right moment to knock him out instantly. Jake is in his prime, while Tyson has been retired too long to get back his old form. Just my honest opinion. But still, I'm team Tyson~!",0,2024-10-26T01:19:27Z,@thesecond4113,Positive,"{'anger': 3, 'fear': 3, 'negative': 2, 'positive': 8, 'trust': 7, 'anticipation': 6, 'joy': 5, 'surprise': 2, 'sadness': 2, 'disgust': 1}",3.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1

Face saving draw for both fighters?
Redemptive humbling defeat for Paul used as a launch pad, given plaudits by Tyson and boxing experts afterward ""this kid can really fight....etc......etc...""
Win for Paul to embellish his ""bad"" reputation.

Not sure which one of these is most likely. Given the sizeable ego's involved it makes it hard to predict.
I picked the draw between Tyson and Roy Jones Jr. But that seemed more obvious to me.

All this stupid social media shit created Jake Paul and put him in this position  fighting Mike Tyson. No way Paul should be fighting for millions of dollars . He hasn't earned it .He lost handily to Tommy Fury (who only has 10 fights).This doesn't give him the cred he thinks it will but I'm sure all his fan boys will praise him as the best.,1,2024-10-15T20:23:20Z,@57briben,Positive,"{'negative': 5, 'anger': 3, 'disgust': 1, 'sadness': 1, 'joy': 1, 'positive': 1, 'trust': 1}",3.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1

I think with Mike Tyson he just has to realize that Jake Paul is a one-dimensional fighter. He's going to be trying to go for The knockout most the fight so Mike just has to be defensively responsible as he hunts him down. I understand Jake Paul is younger but I really don't believe his power is anything Mike has not seen. I believe Jake's power real but I think Mike Tyson's power is something unlike Jake has ever felt. And Mike cannot do anything in Jake's favor feeling sorry for him because Jake will take every advantage he can get.mike has to be mike.meaning knowin jake goin primarily for headshots and jake can b out boxed easily,0,2024-10-15T15:22:56Z,@ljj734,Positive,"{'anger': 2, 'fear': 2, 'negative': 2, 'positive': 5, 'trust': 3, 'anticipation': 1, 'disgust': 1, 'joy': 1, 'sadness': 1, 'surprise': 1}",2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

I honestly think Mike shouldn't have accepted this fight. Father time is UNDEFEATED and Mike is decades past his prime. Why give a bozo like Jake the satisfaction of possibly winning? We all know if Jake wins he's going to act like he's in 1987.,3041,2024-10-15T13:03:19Z,@PatrickRockwell24,Positive,"{'anger': 1, 'fear': 1, 'negative': 1, 'anticipation': 2, 'positive': 2, 'disgust': 1, 'joy': 1, 'sadness': 1, 'surprise': 1, 'trust': 1}",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1
